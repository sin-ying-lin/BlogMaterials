# Blog Materials

You can find the R or Python notebook and associated data file of each blog post here according to its title. <br>
Note that I can only release open source data. <br>
I may be able to release some processed, deidentified private research data, depending on its regulation licence. <br>
<br>
Feel free to leave questions, thouhgts, or comments to me. <br>
Have fun with data! 🐱‍💻
