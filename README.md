# Blog Materials

You can find the R or Python notebook and associated data file of each blog post here according to its title. 
Note that I can only release open source data. 
I may be able to release some processed, deidentified private research data, depending on its regulation licence. 

Feel free to leave questions, thouhgts, or comments to me. 
Have fun with data! 🐱‍💻
